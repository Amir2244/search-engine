Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for calculations. Search algorithms are particularly important in computer science.
The TF-IDF algorithm helps determine how important a word is in a document collection. Term frequency measures how often
a word appears in a document, while inverse document frequency reduces the weight of commonly used words across all documents.
