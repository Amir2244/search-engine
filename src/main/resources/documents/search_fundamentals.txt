Welcome to our distributed search engine! This is a test document about search engines and distributed systems.
Search engines use various algorithms to rank documents. The most common ranking algorithms include TF-IDF scoring.
Distributed systems help us process large amounts of data efficiently. When we distribute the search workload,
we can handle more documents and process search queries faster. This makes our search engine more scalable.
The search engine indexes documents and calculates relevance scores to return the most relevant results first.
